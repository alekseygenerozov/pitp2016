The last session on Thursday (28th) will be  "Lightning Talks"!

This is entirely voluntary, but anybody can sign up to give a 1 minute
- 1 slide talk.  Time is STRICTLY (and BRUTALLY) adhered to. Your
slide can introduce the science you are working on. You have an option
to add a 2nd slide (but you will need to stay within the 60 seconds)
if that contains a graphic or visualization of something you learned
and produced at the PITP.

Slides will need to be emailed to teuben@gmail.com, or directly put in
our git repo in the directory LightningTalks). Please use
the LastnameFirstname.pdf format, e.g.  TeubenPeter.pdf would be my
filename, so we can process the talks alphabetically!

Again, your talk is completely voluntary.
