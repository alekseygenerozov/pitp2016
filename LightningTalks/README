The last thursday session will be "Lightning Talks". This is where
anybody can sign up to give a 1 minute - 1 slide talk talk. Time is
STRICTLY (and BRUTALLY) adhered to. You slide can introduce the science
you are working on. You have an option to add a 2nd slide (but you will
need to stay within the 60 seconds) if that contains a graphic or
visualization of something you produced at the PITP.

Slides will need to be emailed to teuben@gmail.com, or directly put in
our git repo in the directory LightningTalks). Please use
the LastnameFirstname.pdf format, e.g.  TeubenPeter.pdf would be my
filename, so we can process the talks alphabetically!
