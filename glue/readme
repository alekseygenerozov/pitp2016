init_nemo.csh  - creates a few "model" files in case you want to create newer ones
	         (obviously you would need to install NEMO for this)


model1         - rotating disk with a surprise twist

model2         - spiral in a disk
model3         - fits datacube from model2


model1.glu     - session file, but run "make" to create the correct one for you
model3.glu     - session file, but run "make" to create the correct one for you

Makefile       -
configure.ac   - patch the correct directory into the session files
configure      -
