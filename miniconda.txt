Here's a crash-course in making your own python toolkit via miniconda:

Although it is recommended to install the full anaconda system via
            https://www.continuum.io/
this is an alternative if you want to cherry pick your modules and
start with a very small python system.




For miniconda, head over to
     	  http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html
and grab the latest installer and follow instructions for your
architecture.

Here is an example for linux 64 bit:

   wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
   bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
   ...
	I installed it in:   /data2/teuben/python/miniconda3
	This modified my PATH as follows in the .bashrc file:

	export PATH="/data2/teuben/python/miniconda3/bin:$PATH"

   python --version                         (3.5.2)
   conda install ipython
   ipython --version                        (4.2.0)
   conda install numpy scipy matplotlib
   conda install yt
   conda install jupyter

Now you can issue the command (an alias "jn" or just 'j" would seem to make a lot of sense here)

    jupyter notebook

and in your browser you will now see python notebooks (ipynb files) if you are in the right
directory.
