This is the meta directory to aid in installing the ca_packages for PITP2009 and PITP2016
See: http://carma.astro.umd.edu/wiki/index.php/Ca_install

typical invocation:
    configure 
    make
    make install


The 'config' subdirectory is a set of m4 macros that were largely
taken from the xoopic/xgrafic package.
